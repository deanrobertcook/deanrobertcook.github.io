title:  The Hitchhiker's Guide to Learning German

### Universal tips:
* Decide if you need to be able to produce or just consume the language and to what level you need to learn it. Production is significantly harder and you may be better off just aiming to understand a language. For this reason, be very clear what your goals are and **don't** try and be noble here, be honest with yourself and question your underlying motives, otherwise you're in for a lot of unnecessary discomfort e.g:
  * To travel to the place: intermediate level consumption, low level production
  * To work in the language: intermediate to high level production and consumption
  * To reach (what we naturally think of as) fluency: high level production and consumption
  * Proving you're smart enough to learn a language: intermediate level production and consumption
  * To show off how many languages you know: intermediate level production and consumption
  * To understand a loved one in their native language: high level consumption
  * To consume content in the language (books/TV shows): high level consumption
  * To communicate with more people around the world: for German, high level consumption, intermediate level production
  * To blend in as a native: stupid high level production and consumption
* Avoid group courses - unless you want to meet some interesting people, but very low utility for learning the language.
* Don't bother with DuoLingo - I've not heard of a serious language learner who does

### Absolute Beginner (A1)
* Consumption Goal: abolish your misconceptions of German, get the sounds/letters down
* Production Goal: learn how to pronounce the alphabet, say your name and where you're from
* Start to establish a *daily* routine (e.g. 15 minutes a day)
* Work through a well-structured course, e.g. [Babbel](www.babbel.com). Get a basic overview of how the grammar works, get the basics down - don't be pedantic here!
* Start shadowing as you listen and read - do this for the rest of your time in the language
* Individual tutoring might be a waste of time and money at this point

### Upper Beginner (A2)
* Goal: To develop a feel for the language, start speaking about basic things
* Switch Babbel for [LingQ](https://www.lingq.com/en/) to read and listen to interesting content. LingQ enables you to punch a bit above your weight, keeping the reading interesting. You should be absolutely hammering LingQ with lots of shadowing.
* Look for opportunities to have simple conversations with natives: order things at shops, maybe have a (max!) 30min conversation with a close friend, etc.
* You will feel your brain heating up with each encounter in the language - it's hard work at this point. Don't overdo it.

### Lower Intermediate (B1)
* Consumption goal: build up a small library of interesting, native-level material in fields that interest you, read your first book or understand your first native level podcast. See my [list of resources](TODO).
* Production goal: Get to the point where you can talk a bit about most of the things in your life in very broad terms. Write your first diary entry in German.
* If you can afford it, start to consider 1:1 tutoring on a regular basis. Try out [iTalki](https://www.italki.com/dashboard) for online tutoring. Again, I wouldn't do too much, as it's still going to be hard at this point.
* If you can afford to, now's a good time to travel to a GSC and try out your first language immersion project, at best up to a few months (avoid big cities like Berlin and Vienna)
* As you read and listen to things, start applying the bucket method. Start using [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to gather examples that *you have encountered* and apply the enhanced bucket method
* Keep hammering LingQ on a daily basis, keep shadowing. Keep doing your ankis every day

### Upper Intermediate and Advanced (B2+)
* Thoroughly reconsider if you want to keep going: from here on out it takes a lot of practice and consistency.
* Consumption goal: understand just about everything you hear/see - use the language as your lens to the world
* Production goal: speak without an accent - handle any situation at any time in the language
* Steadily start to drop off on LingQ as you feel you don't need the dictionary so much anymore.
* Try to find the translation for any books you want to read
* Never stop shadowing, never stop the (enhanced) bucket method, never stop your Ankis
* As often as possible, immerse yourself in German, doing everything you can in the language for a few months on end
* Take breaks! After intense immersion periods, try doing another hobby for a few months and fall back to just doing your ankis every day and reading/listening to things for fun. I find learning another language for a while helps you realise how far you've come.
* Start to ask friends to always speak German to you. During your breaks from intense learning, don't be afraid to speak a bit of English with them - motivation is key!
* Look for more activities to do in the language - you can probably start to work in the language now, or go on dates or meet new people at events.
* Hammer the 1:1 tutoring if you can afford it - even if you're speaking a lot, tutoring is a good time to iron-out your mistakes. Most regular encounters don't afford you the luxury of saying the same thing 10 times until you get it right.
* Be careful that as long as you still have an accent (if you've been shadowing enough, hopefully this won't be an issue), GS will often try to speak English with you. Learn to pick your battles and decide whether to fight them back into German or just let this one English encounter slip by. Don't let your ego get the better of you - motivation is key!
* Now you're probably safe to move to a bigger city
* Rinse and repeat for the next 5-10 years until people don't realise you're not a GS anymore
