title:  "Unlocking creativity. How to give your Bauchgefühl the reins to your life"
---
* Look for remote work if possible, or think of ways to fit work around your life, not the other way around. I needed a lot of time to stumble on and develop this process. Hopefully this guide will speed up this process for you (or me, should I ever lose it in the future).
* Set up a second brain (notion): outsource long-term memory. It's okay to spend upwards of 2 weeks setting this up, if not more. The second brain has two functions: it should be a dictionary data structure, where the keys are nodes to other parts of the internet and external world, while also serving as a place for you to dump all your ideas so you can easily sort them later (sleeping your second brain).
* Write your List - give every part of your imagination equal weighting. If you feel like your actively working on something, your ability in that domain will decay less rapidly and encourages you to work harder. The List brings this effect to everything you could possible want to do.
* Use Iteration to make progress on each item simultaneously - look for the smallest possible thing you can do to advance one of your goals, do it as quickly as possible and get it to the smallest possible audience for fast feedback. Repeat this process forever.
* When you start iterating, progress on your List comes in the form of more idea generation - there is often one idea that makes the path forward clear or even gives you a shortcut to achieving one of your goals. The work itself becomes obvious and almost mechanical. This point was for me counterintuitive, I expected the work to be boring and hard.
* The idea space is also fractal - the closer you look for ideas, the more you find and the faster you'll make progress towards your goals.
* Shift to working in fortnights - more optimal period for batching work (week too short, month too long). As you journal each day, write a little subscript as to which week it is, e.g. Mo1, Tue1... Su1, Mo2, Tue2... So2. This helps you keep track of which week it is more easily.
* Use HelloFresh (and others) for efficient meals (efficient here meaning having found an optimum on the price-taste-health curve, while also teaching you how to cook, providing another domain for creativity to grow in)
* Prioritise sleep over everything, but learn to manage insomnia and tiredness. Learn to listen to your body and not have that "one coffee too many".
* Travel a lot to local cafes and even across your city to work: take advantage of the increased learn effect.
* No heavy workouts if not well-slept (chance of injury increases 50% when <6 hours of sleep).
* Exercise needs to be fun - try to learn skills while sweating
* Use the extra efficiency and energy to organise your second brain: think of it serving the same purpose sleep does for your first brain
* Use weed to avoid listlessness and burnout. Only use when tired, aim to not ever be tired (should ideally translate to <2 joints a week).
* Occasionally take a psychedelic - make it a ceremony (set and setting), study something abstract (philosophy, maths, physics, evolutionary theory etc.) in the weeks beforehand.
* Look for places you can trade money for time or comfort: for example, buy an air conditioner to help you sleep better and work at your peak.
* Finally: when ideas grip you - have the courage to go with them. Show your Bauchgefühl some respect and let it learn.
* When an idea strikes and you undertake a new project, keep an eye out for people in your area who would benefit greatly from helping you do the project. Share the ideas with them.
* If you can keep going, keep going: ideas will strike at inconvenient moments, sometimes waking up up in the middle of the night. If possible, start working straight away (inspiration is perishable). At the very least, write down a quick plan and get it into your second brain.
* Paper, pen, whiteboards, voice recordings etc. are fantastic for fostering creativity, use them freely, but get the ideas into a **written electronic** form ASAP (as part of sleeping the brain). Take photos or scan things, distill the key ideas, put them somewhere that makes sense.
* Keep your phone and laptop near your bed each night. You will often wake up with extreme fervour and being able to get to work from the warmth of your bed with dim lights as your eyes are still adjusting will lower the effort needed to get those ideas out.
