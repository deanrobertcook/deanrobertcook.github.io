title:  "Unlocking creativity. How to give your Bauchgefühl the reins to your life"

* Set up a second brain (notion): outsource long-term memory. It's okay to spend upwards of 2 weeks setting this up. The second brain has two functions: it should be a dictionary data structure, where the keys are nodes to other parts of the internet and external world, while also serving as a place for you to dump all your ideas so you can easily sort them later (sleeping your second brain).
* Write your List - give every part of your imagination equal weighting
* Use Iteration to make progress on each item simultaneously
* Progress on your List comes in the form of idea generation - there is often one idea that makes the path forward clear or even gives you a shortcut to achieving one of your goals. The space is also fractal - the closer you look for ideas, the more you find
* Shift to working in fortnights - more optimal period for batching work (week too short, month too long)
* Use HelloFresh (and others) for efficient meals
* Prioritise sleep over everything, but learn to manage insomnia and tiredness. Learn to listen to your body and not have that "one coffee too many".
* Travel a lot to local cafes and even across your city to work: take advantage of the increased learn effect.
* No heavy workouts if not well-slept (chance of injury increases 50% when <6 hours of sleep).
* Exercise needs to be fun - try to learn skills while sweating
* Use the extra efficiency and energy to organise your second brain: think of it serving the same purpose sleep does for your first brain
* Use weed to avoid listlessness and burnout. Only use when tired, aim to not ever be tired (should ideally translate to <2 joints a week).
* Occasionally take a psychedelic - make it a ceremony (set and setting), study something abstract (philosophy, maths, physics, evolutionary theory etc.) in the weeks beforehand.
* Finally: when ideas grip you - have the courage to go with them. Show your Bauchgefühl some respect and let it learn.
* When an idea strikes and you undertake a new project, keep an eye out for people in your area who would benefit greatly from helping you do the project. Share the ideas with them.
